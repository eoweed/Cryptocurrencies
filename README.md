# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview:
###### The purpose of this project is to analyze cryptocurrency data using the K-Means clustering algorithm to determine which types of cryptocurrencies would be ideal for an investment. 
###### The data is cleaned and preprocessed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of dimensions in the dataset to three columns. Then the K-Means algorithm is fit to the data to create four classes or groups.

### Results:
###### The results are visualized using plotly express and hvplot.

###### The 3D graph shows the cryptocurrencies separated into four classes and plotted along the dimensions created in the Principle Component Analysis.

###### The scatter plot also shows the cryptocurrencies separated by class and plotted based on Total Coin Supply and Total Coins Mined.

###### A table shows the cryptocurrencies that are available to be traded and have a Total Coin Supply greater than zero.
