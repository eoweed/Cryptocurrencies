# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview:
###### The purpose of this project is to analyze cryptocurrency data using the K-Means clustering algorithm to determine which types of cryptocurrencies would be ideal for an investment. 
###### The data is cleaned and preprocessed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of dimensions in the dataset to three columns. Then the K-Means algorithm is fit to the data to create four clusters of the data.

### Results:
###### The results are visualized using plotly express and hvplot. The 3D graph shows the cryptocurrencies separated by class and plotted along the dimensions created in the Principle Component Analysis. The scatter plot shows the cryptocurrencies separated by class and plotted based on Total Coin Supply and Total Coins Mined.
